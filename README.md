I've been inspired by W3Schools way to make this image slider. Only difference is that I tried to add in some JQuery to make it simpler and easier for other developers to understand.

 - Line 1-18: Begin to ready the site with document.ready and function
 - Line 3: Declare the image to have a slideIndex, so there is exist a variable for the action of sliding.
 - Line 5: Create a function that initializes the slides and make one primar image(the first one to begin with), the only image on the site.
 - Line 6: Create variables for the images.
 - Line 7-9: Make a loop that tells the images that exist to dissapear.
 - Line 10: Declare that the action of sliding continues forever.
 - Line 11-13: Make an if statement that tells that the current iteration number should be an exception and not dissapear.
 - Line 15: Set a timeout that tells the images to run within a specific timeset. 
 - Line 17: Call the function to show slides.
